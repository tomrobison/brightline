# Staff DevSecOps Engineer - LODAS

At LODAS, we're building the future of alternative investment liquidity, powered by technology, disciplined operations, and a collaborative, mission-driven culture. Each team member plays a meaningful role in ensuring that our clients, partners, and internal teams experience seamless, accurate, and compliant processes every day. The DevSecOps Engineer will be a critical part of this effort, designing and operating the infrastructure, automation, and security foundations that enable our engineering teams to move quickly while maintaining the highest standards of reliability and trust as the company continues to grow.

## Role Overview

We are seeking a Staff DevSecOps Engineer to provide technical leadership across our AWS based production environments and CI CD platform. This role sits at the intersection of DevOps, site reliability engineering, and security, with a strong focus on architecture, standards, and enablement. You will own and evolve our serverless infrastructure strategy, embed security by design, and raise the bar for reliability, scalability, and operational excellence across teams.

As a staff level engineer, you will operate with a high degree of autonomy, influence technical direction across multiple teams, and act as a force multiplier through mentorship, design reviews, and platform improvements. This role defines, enforces, and evolves platform, security, and reliability standards across engineering teams, serving as a technical authority and escalation point for complex infrastructure and security decisions.

## Key Responsibilities

- Lead the architecture, design, and evolution of secure CI CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, including SAST and DAST scanning, vulnerability management, and compliance automation
- Own infrastructure as code standards and patterns using Terraform across AWS services such as Aurora PostgreSQL, ECS Fargate, Lambda, SQS, and related serverless components
- Define, enforce, and evolve organization wide platform, security, and reliability standards across AWS environments
- Define and drive SRE best practices for availability, observability, incident response, and capacity planning across production systems
- Design and maintain observability platforms for logging, metrics, and tracing, ensuring actionable visibility across AWS environments
- Establish and automate security guardrails including IAM design, encryption standards, secrets management, threat modeling, and shift left security practices at scale
- Own secrets management and key management strategies using AWS KMS, Secrets Manager, and related tooling across CI CD and runtime environments
- Define and maintain AWS multi account strategy, including account structure, environment isolation, and cross account access patterns
- Drive cloud cost optimization efforts, including cost visibility, budgeting guardrails, and architectural guidance to balance performance, reliability, and spend
- Own and manage compliance tooling including Vanta, ensuring continuous control monitoring and audit readiness
- Lead responses to customer and partner security questionnaires, working with engineering and leadership to provide accurate, consistent, and timely answers
- Partner with engineering leadership to influence platform decisions, reliability goals, and overall security posture
- Lead complex incident reviews and postmortems, driving systemic improvements rather than point fixes
- Act as an escalation partner for engineers on call, assisting with complex incidents, root cause analysis, and remediation without serving as a primary on call responder
- Mentor engineers across DevOps, platform, and application teams through reviews, pairing, and technical guidance

## Required Skills and Experience

- Six or more years of experience in DevOps, SRE, Platform Engineering, or SecOps roles
- Deep hands on experience with AWS, particularly serverless and managed services such as Aurora, ECS Fargate, Lambda, and SQS
- Experience designing and operating multi account AWS environments with strong isolation, governance, and security controls
- Expert level proficiency with Terraform for infrastructure as code and GitHub Actions or similar CI CD platforms
- Strong experience integrating security and compliance into pipelines using tools such as Snyk or AWS native security services
- Experience owning compliance platforms such as Vanta and supporting SOC 2 or similar audit frameworks
- Advanced scripting and automation skills in Python, Bash, or similar languages
- Strong understanding of cloud security architecture, container security, and compliance frameworks such as NIST or SOC 2
- Proven experience operating and scaling highly reliable production systems using tools like CloudWatch, Prometheus, or equivalent
- Ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly to both engineers and non technical stakeholders
- AWS DevOps, security specialty, or professional level certifications are a plus, along with security certifications such as CompTIA Security+, CISSP, or GIAC
